How to Use:

1) Open PerfectCell.m (this is the main)

2) Pick your favorite image under image selection (or add a new one)

3) Run !



General Algorithm: 

1) Pre-process Image (Canny edge detection)
2) Use bounding box for a blob and extract arrays for x and y where the image is white (1)
3) Traverse through the blob (from left to right) using neighborhood approximation (myNeighbor.m) until a max height(technically when y is the smallest) is reached
4) If traversal is long enough, store the points of the start and end (this becomes the blue line that is used in approximations)
5) Change direction of traversal and continue the same process
6) Same as #4 (Note that the last neighbor found here should be at the rightmost side of the shape)
7) Reset back to the leftmost side of the image, and go in the opposite direction of the first iteration (repeat 3,4,5,6)
8) Use the resulting data (the linear approximations) to determine the shape (there are many more detailed internal conditions inside of discriminate.m)



Accuracy:
Good: Tringles, Rectangles, Squares, Circles
Decent: Semicircles, Quarter Circles, Trapezoids
Abysmal: Stars(Disabled), Crosses, QR Codes

Ask if you have any questions =) !
